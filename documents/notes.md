### Front-end learnings-
1. To define a style for a text element, mark it as !important in styles.css as otherwise it gets overwritten by tailwind. Also define it in tailwind.config.js. See h1 and h3 for reference.
2. Use images whereever possible. For eg it took more than a day to design half of the complicated components on http://127.0.0.1:8080/signup1_cursor.html, but it just took minutes to copy the components from figma to html, which also looked better.

### Instructions-
1. Do not make theoritical assumptions, review the given files first before answering.
